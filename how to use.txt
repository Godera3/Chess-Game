Prerequisites (All OS)

Before starting, ensure you have:

    A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC) installed.
    A terminal or command prompt to execute commands.
    Access to the chess code file (Chess {New}.cpp).




  
// Here is Steps for Each Operating System


// WINDOWS
    Install a Compiler:
    Download and install "MinGW" or "TDM-GCC"
    Alternatively, install Visual Studio and select "Desktop development with C++" during setup.


    Open Command Prompt: Press "Win + R", type "cmd", and press Enter.
    Navigate to Your Project Folder: "cd path\to\your\project"


    Compile the Code:  g++ -std=c++17 -o chess_game "Chess.cpp"
    And after compiling to run the code use command "chess_game" or whatever the name you used while compiling the .cpp file




// MacOS
    install Xcode or VSCode or use a IDE which you like.

    Open your Project folder from terminal using this command: cd /path/to/your/project
    Compile the code: g++ -std=c++17 -o chess_game "Chess.cpp"
    And run the game using this command: ./chess_game         or whatever the name you used while compiling the .cpp file


    
// Linux
    Install GCC/Clang:
    In terminal run following commands (For Ubuntu/Debian):       sudo apt update          &         sudo apt install g++   
    Navigate to your project folder:   cd /path/to/your/project
    Compile the code:     g++ -std=c++17 -o chess_game "Chess.cpp"
    Run the Game:   ./chess_game















                                            //  Common Issues and Fixes

1. File Not Found:

    Ensure Chess.cpp is in the directory youâ€™re compiling from.


2. Compiler Not Recognized:

    Add the compiler to your system's PATH environment variable.


Permission Issues (macOS/Linux):

    If you encounter permission issues running the file, grant executable permissions: chmod +x chess_game


                  










                                              // Optional: Using an IDE

If you prefer not to use the terminal, you can use an IDE like Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, or CLion:

    Open the IDE and create a new project.
    Add the Chess {New}.cpp file to the project.
    Configure the compiler settings to use C++17.
    Build and run the project directly from the IDE.
