    Navigate to Your Project Folder: "cd path\to\your\project"


    Compile the Code:  g++ -std=c++17 -o chess_game "Chess.cpp"
    And after compiling to run the code use command "chess_game" or whatever the name you used while compiling the .cpp file




// MacOS
    install Xcode or VSCode or use a IDE which you like.

    Open your Project folder from terminal using this command: cd /path/to/your/project
    Compile the code: g++ -std=c++17 -o chess_game "Chess.cpp"
    And run the game using this command: ./chess_game         or whatever the name you used while compiling the .cpp file


    
// Linux
    Install GCC/Clang:
    In terminal run following commands (For Ubuntu/Debian):       sudo apt update          &         sudo apt install g++   
    Navigate to your project folder:   cd /path/to/your/project
    Compile the code:     g++ -std=c++17 -o chess_game "Chess.cpp"
    Run the Game:   ./chess_game
